      <p>This dataset is pretty cool, it’s almost what I need for my PhD on seahorse behaviour. But I find some problems in the performed methodology, and I would like to contact the author to check if it’s possible to access a raw, punprocessed dataset</p>
      <p>I’ve been processing the data on an Excel file and the total ampount of occurrences I find does not match with the amount given by the GBIF filtering.</p>

      <p>Hi Leslie. I’ve had the same problemas and (good news!) they can be fixed. What you have to do is this and that and.</p>

      <p>Mmm I disagree. I think this dataset has a big problem with the recolection methodology used for capturing seahorses. The author is using lactose to bail them, a well-recognized toxic substance for this kind of creatures.</p>
